<br>
<p><font size="4" style="arial bold"color="pink">The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 90,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</font></p>

<h2><font size="7" color="Red" face="Arial bold">Red Fort</font></h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ee3KP4n.jpg"border="7">
<p><font size="4"style="arial bold"color="silver">The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.<br><br>

Location in Delhi, India, Asia
The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.<br>

On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.<br><br>

The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex</font></p>

<h2><font size="7"color="Yellow"face="arial bold">Qutub Minar</font></h2>

<p><font size="4" style="arial bold"color="aqua">The Qutb Minar, also spelled as Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of New Delhi, India.It is one of most visited tourist spots in the city due to it being one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent.<br><br>
It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c 1190, which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist</font></p>

<h2><font size="7"color="orange"face="arial bold">Lotus Temple</font></h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jDFyI0G.jpg"border="7">
<p><font size="4" style="arial bold"color="#00BFFF">The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple is a “silent teacher” of the Bahá'í faith.The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 2,500 people. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in the world.</font></p>

<h2><font size="7"color="red"face="arial bold">Humayun's Tomb</font></h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pUSJ3K8.jpg"border="7">
<p><font size="4" style="arial bold"color="aqua">Humayun's tomb (Hindustani or Urdu: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum),in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad,Persian architects chosen by her.It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent,and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in 1533. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale.The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete.Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.
